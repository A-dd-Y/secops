#### China-Nexus TTPs Hunting

##### The attacker use initial infection via USB devices, the threat actor leveraged legitimately signed binaries to side-load malware, including three new families Mandiant refer to as MISTCLOAK, DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE. Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed NCAT binary and execution of a reverse shell on the victimâ€™s system, providing backdoor access to the threat actor. The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives that are plugged into a compromised system, allowing the malicious payloads to propagate to additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.
